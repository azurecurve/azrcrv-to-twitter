# Description

To Twitter includes the following functionality;
 * Automatic tweeting of posts and pages to Twitter as they are published.
 * Automatic retweeting of posts and pages a user specified period of time after publication.
 * Scheduled tweeting of posts and pages on a randomly selected basis at a user specified date and time (each day separately configurable).
 * Automatic adding of hashtags to posts and pages (save draft before manually adding any required hashtags).
 * Automatic replacement of word or phrases with hashtags (for example, switch the word `ClassicPress` for `@GetClassicPress`).
 * Sending of manual tweets (including tweet threads).
 * Sending of scheduled tweets (including tweet threads) at a user specified date and time.
 * Support for four media images attached to a tweet from posts, pages, manual and scheduled tweets.
 * Integrates with [Short URLs](https://development.azurecurve.co.uk/classicpress-plugins/short-urls/) from [azurecurve](https://development.azurecurve.co.uk/classicpress-plugins/ for post and page addresses in tweets.
 * Retain and view tweet history.
 * Links to tweets on Twitter in tweet history.

As scheduled tweets rely on cron for processing, large images can cause timeouts. This can be mitigated by switching off the wp-cron and setting up a cron job on your web host control panel.

This plugin is multisite compatible with each site having its own settings.
